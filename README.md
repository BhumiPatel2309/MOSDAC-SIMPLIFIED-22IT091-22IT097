MOSDAC SIMPLIFIED is an intelligent AI-based assistant that simplifies access to complex satellite meteorological data hosted on the MOSDAC[https://www.mosdac.gov.in/] platform. This project includes a web-scraper, a knowledge graph-based question-answering (QA) bot, and a user-friendly interface. Users can ask natural language questions, and the bot responds with accurate, context-aware answers retrieved from scraped content using state-of-the-art NLP techniques and LLMs. Built with LangChain, Neo4j, FAISS, and HuggingFace, this project aims to democratize access to earth observation insights for students, researchers, and the general public.
